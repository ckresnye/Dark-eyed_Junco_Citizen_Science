# Dark-eyed_Junco_Citizen_Science
Python project exploring the accuracy of tagged social media data regarding the range and migration habits of the dark-eyed junco bird.

## Project Overview
This project consists of four components:
* Importing and Analyzing known bird sighting range from the [EBird](https://ebird.org/home) dataset
* Webscrapping Instagram for posts tagging dark-eyed juncos
* Using Google Cloud's computer vision API to verify the scrapped image contains a bird
* Comparing the known ranges with the social media tagged posts

## About the Dark-eyed Junco
The dark-eyed junco is a common sparrow found across north america. This small bird was chosen as the first species for this project as its broad range and population size may lead to more bird watchers observing it and posting about it on social media.

## Project Parts
### Importing verified Data Points
The first step was to cleanup the data to be analyzed, and format it for further analysis. This involved converting txt files provided by Ebird to CSV, as shown in the file.
